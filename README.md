## Salary Prediction project
My Animal Classification [DOG or CAT] project is a Machine learning using using neural networks for classification to help everyone do classification based on images.
	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Python version: Python 3.6.

## Machine Learning Term

### CNN:
    CNN is a powerful algorithm for image processing. These algorithms are currently the best algorithms we have for the automated processing of images. Many companies use these algorithms to do things like identifying the objects in an image.

    CNN is mainly used in image analysis tasks like Image recognition, Object detection & Segmentation.

    Convolutional Layer:
        In a typical neural network each input neuron is connected to the next hidden layer. In CNN, only a small region of the input layer neurons connect to the neuron hidden layer.

    Pooling Layer: 
        The pooling layer is used to reduce the dimensionality of the feature map. There will be multiple activation & pooling layers inside the hidden layer of the CNN.

     Fully-Connected layer: 
        Fully Connected Layers form the last few layers in the network. The input to the fully connected layer is the output from the final Pooling or Convolutional Layer, which is flattened and then fed into the fully connected layer.
## Setup
To run this project, install Jupyter Notebook:
